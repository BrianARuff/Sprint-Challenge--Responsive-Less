1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

  Adaptive design uses seperate layouts for each device type that it supports (typically mobile, tablet and desktop). It will can use static values like pixels because the layout is specfically for the device it's rendering on. Media queries play a big role in this type of design.

  Responsive design strictly uses relative units and one stylesheet for it's purposes. It can work well on any screen because relative units will scale appropriately. Relative units are based off the viewport rather than the window size. Types of relative units include rem, em and percentages.
